Important safety tips — avoid scams

Never use “gift card generators” or “free code” download sites. Those are scams/malware traps.

Don’t share gift-card codes, passwords, or verification codes. Scammers ask for codes to “reserve” prizes — that’s theft.

If an offer requires payment or asks for your Microsoft/Xbox password to receive a free code, it’s a scam.

Check official Microsoft/Xbox pages or reputable sites before trusting an offer.
